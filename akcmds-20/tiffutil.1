.SH NAME
tiffutil \- manipulates tiff files
.SH SYNOPSIS
tiffutil <option> [<arguments>] [-out <outfile>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
tiffutil lets you manipulate TIFF files. The list of options (also available by
running the program without any options) follows:
.PP
tiffutil -none      infile                  [-out outfile]
         -lzw       infile                  [-out outfile]
         -packbits  infile                  [-out outfile]
         -cat       infile1 [infile2 ...]   [-out outfile]
         -extract   num infile              [-out outfile]
         -fix       infile                  [-out outfile]
         -info      infile\n
.PP
-none, -lzw, and -packbits options specify the compression format
to be applied to the images in the TIFF file.  -none specifies no compression; -packbits specifies PackBits compression; -lzw specifies standard 
Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression (no prediction scheme).
.PP
-cat allows combining multiple TIFF files into one.  The images are
copied without any change in tag values.
.PP
-extract allows extracting an individual image from a TIFF file; specify
num = 0 for the first image in the file.
.PP
-fix fixes TIFF monochrome images with alpha generated by the 1.0 NeXT software. (These images work with 2.0; however, their photometric value is 5, 
which conflicts with the post-5.0 TIFF standard photometric value of 5,
assigned to CMYK color images.)
.PP
-info dumps information about TIFF images. 
.PP
For all of the options except for -info, the output goes to "out.tiff" unless
an output file name is specified after a -out keyword.  This keyword and the
file must be the last items on the command line. -info writes the output to
the standard output.
.PP
If there are multiple images in a TIFF file the specified operation will be
performed on all of them.
