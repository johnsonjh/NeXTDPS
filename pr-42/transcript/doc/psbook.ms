and the

are published by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company of Reading, Mass.

The
.I
\*(PS Language Reference Manual
.R
is the complete definitive reference guide to the \*(PS language.
It begins with a discussion of the basic ideas
that underlie \*(PS, followed by comprehensive presentations of
the language and its graphics and font facilities.  The precise
semantics of every \*(PS operator is detailed in a convenient
dictionary-like format.  The manual concludes with four
appendices on the standard fonts, implementation limits, structuring
conventions, and the Apple LaserWriter.

The
.I
\*(PS Language Tutorial and Cookbook
.R
provides a thorough, clearly written guide to \*(PS
that outlines the features and capabilities of the language and
shows practical ways to create useful \*(PS programs.  Using
annotated examples and short programs, the tutorial
provides a step-by-step guided tour of \*(PS, highlighting
those qualities that make it such a unique and powerful language.
The cookbook offers a collection of some of the most useful
techniques and procedures available to \*(PS programmers.

\fBThese books should be available in your local bookstore.\fP Most
bookstores will accept orders using the ISBN (International Standard Book
Number) codes given above.  If you are unable to locate the books in your
area, Adobe will sell them for list price plus shipping and handling (see
